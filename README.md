# thermography-analysis
Synthetic-data-driven framework for industrial pipe thermography monitoring. Generates thermographic images with UNO-Flux, simulates temporal heat diffusion, detects anomalies via color-based frame analysis, and uses LLMs to create human-readable reports for predictive maintenance and safety.
